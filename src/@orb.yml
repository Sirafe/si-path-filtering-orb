  Continue a pipeline based on paths of changed files.
  This can be useful in a monorepo setup where one may want to trigger different workflows
  based on which module(s) in the repo has changed.
  This version of the orb also supports providing a reference tag. This will allow building
  based on this tag reference to the previos commit of the same tag matching the reference.
  This will allow you to not lose commits between the tags as which normally happens on the
  original version of this orb.
  This orb does not support server at this time.
  This is a fork of the original adding support for mono-repos using a trunk based flow with
  a tagged release style.
