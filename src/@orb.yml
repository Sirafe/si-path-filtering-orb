  Continue a pipeline based on paths of changed files.
  This can be useful in a monorepo setup where one may want to trigger different workflows
  based on which module(s) in the repo has changed.
  This orb does not support server at this time.
  This is a fork of the original adding support for mono-repos using a trunk based flow with 
  either tagged or long lived branch release styles.
